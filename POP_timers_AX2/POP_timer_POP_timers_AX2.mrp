Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: Using local reset signal 'POPtimers/counterreset' to infer global
     GSR net.
WARNING - map: The reset of EBR 'TinyFPGA_A2_reveal_coretop_instance/tinyfpga_a2
     _la0_inst_0/trig_u/te_0/pmi_ram_dpXO2binarynonespeedasyncdisablereg14161416
     /pmi_ram_dpXbnonesadr141614161164462a_0_0_0' cannot be controlled. The
     local reset is not connected to any control signal and set to GND. The
     global reset is disabled via GSR property. To control the EBR reset, either
     connect the local reset to a control signal or force the GSR property to be
     enabled.

                                   Page 20




Design:  TinyFPGA_A2                                   Date:  02/25/22  16:39:24

GSR Usage (cont)
----------------
   The local reset signal 'POPtimers/counterreset' of the design has been
        inferred as Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR
        control is 'POPtimers/counterreset'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
