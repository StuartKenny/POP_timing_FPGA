---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'POPtimers/counterreset' of the design has been
        inferred as Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR
        control is 'POPtimers/counterreset'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
